                There is a very famous quote by Hellen Keller, “Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.” An adventure is something challenging, that takes us out of our ordinary lives and forces us to try new things. The definition of adventure varies from person
                to person. It can best be described as, “The risky undertaking of an unknown outcome, the result of which may also be dangerous or in favour.”
                <br> <br> While the definition of adventure can vary from person to person, in broader context “risk taken when its outcome is unknown” can be termed as adventure. It is something that challenges you, it is something that lets you escape
                from your ordinary lives & thus it is something that changes you. It can make you feel more live & refreshed. Adventures can be sought in numerous ways such as mountaineering, river rafting, trekking, skydiving, scuba diving, etc. Even
                exploring new people & cities can be considered as an adventure.

                Surfing is a sport that is often considered as much an attitude or way of life as it is a sport. Surfing is mostly enjoyed as a recreational activity, but is also a competitive sport.Surfing involves riding ocean waves with a surfboard. To catch a wave
                the surfer swims a ways out into the ocean lying on their stomach on the surfboard. When a wave comes the surfer aims the board into land and begins to paddle to "catch" the wave.
                <br> <br> A surfing holiday is the perfect combination of vitamin sea, a new destination, and connecting deeply with nature and this beautiful world we live in. Nothing reawakens the soul like being one with the ocean.Going on a surf adventure
                is the perfect post- pandemic trip because you get to experience something totally different and use both your body and mind to learn something new!
